The following list contains open issues for Burn.app. It is sorted in
a somewhat prioritised order.

o libburn/libisofs backend

o libparanoia backend to replace cdparanoia backend
  (was: Develop and implement an interface and common ripping bundle for
        Encod ! and Burn.app.)

----> Here we release 0.4.2. The rest on this list is for later versions.

o Write conversion backends for Ogg/Vorbis to be able to treat them
  as music and not only data.

o Display an indicator in the compilation window when burning process
  is running for this compilation.

o Allow muti-session disks to be created.

o The same file may not be inserted more than once to a CD compilation.
  mkisofs will make trouble.

o Track inspector should show the CD name instead of CDDB ID (if possible).

o Improve handling of multiple tracks in track inspector.

o Copy on-the-fly.

o Remove CD info from Project and put it into a separate database. Thus,
  we have immediate access from everywhere in the app to CD info.

o Use libaudiofile for reading an audio file's header data.

o Clean up the code for duration and size handling of Track. Currently
  we need ugly conversions everywhere.

o Log output to file for post-mortem debugging.
