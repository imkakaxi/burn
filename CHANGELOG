Version 0.5.0
-------------

Changes:

- The project window now uses a confugurable toolbar instead of those
  two buttons.
- Files can now be added using the NSOpenPanel. This is handy if you don't
  use GWorkspace for D'n'D.
- The parameters dialog is opened always before burning as this is
  safer. The old parameters may not match your current compilation
  which could be fatal.
- The inspectors have undergone a major overhaul:
  * Besides some visual changes, the track inspector has now an 'Open'
    button by which the selected track may be opened with its preferred
    viewer application.
  * The media and audio cd inspectors now display their data in an outline
    view, which makes them clearer.
- The main application and the bundles now use reasonable defaults. Thus the
  user is no longer forced to run the preferences upon the first start.
- The hardware detection is now more robust and reliable.
- D'n'D has been fixed to work with the latest GNUstep.
- The bundles now have the extension 'burntool' to avoid problems with
  double loading other bundles, e.g. back.
- New icons.

Fixed issues:
- Building and installing has been adapted to the latest GNUstep make.
- Removed the class 'Image' that was used as 'poseAs' for NSImage. This
  was a hack because a lot of Gorm files had references to Camaelon's
  'Image' class. These have been fixed, now.
- Fixed issues with writing the preferences/parameters back to user
  defaults database.
- Lots of other bug fixes, mainly for segfaults.

Version 0.4.1
-------------

WARNING: Due to the usage of a late version of Gorm you must use GNUstep
         GUI later than 0.9.3!!!

Changes:

- The cdrecord and cdrdao backends are now able to handle ATAPI devices.
  This, however, requires fairly recent versions of those tools (see README).
- Added overburn option for both backends. Currently this must be switched
  on manually in the parameters dialog. Maybe in the future we may try to
  detect this automatically.
- The cdrdao backend bundle is no longer built and installed by default,
  but must be handled separately. This makes things easier for me :-)
- The cdrdao backend now knows the method -availableDrives using cdrdao's
  'scanbus' command.
- The 'Burn Tools' panel has now moved to the preferences.
- Split the service 'Burn To CD' into two again: 'Burn To CD' and 'Add To CD'.
  This gets us rid of the annoying 'do you want to append or create new...'
  message.
- ISO image files may now be opened with a double-click or 'gopen' (Burn.app
  registers for suffix .iso).
- The miniwindow for the BurnProgress panel now displays the progress.
- Removed the track types raw-intel and raw-motorola. Noone needs this.
- Add functionality to plug-in audio converters, i.e. bundles that convert
  arbitrary audio formats into .wav files.
- Add a converter bundle for MP3 files. This bundle is part of the CVS, but
  not of th release package.

Fixed Bugs/Issues:
- Fixed a bug where the 'burnproof' option for cdrecord was was not written
  properly to the defaults and thus not used at all.


Version 0.4.0
-------------

Changes:

- Went back to using multiple compilation windows.
- Burning is no loger modal. All operations not involving the burner
  stay accessible while burning.
- Burn ISO images directly from GWorkspace via a service or from
  within Burn.app.
- Complete overhaul of the DnD system. We can now also insert a
  dragged directories contents and we can do so recursively.
- Paste no longer accepts file names.
- The burn parameters are now set in the parameters panel
  instead of the compilation window.
- The service "Burn to CD" now asks whether to add the tracks
  to the top most opened compilation or whether to open a new one.
- Added a new service "Burn ISO Image" accepting the name of an ISO
  image file.
- The inspectors' layout changed slightly.
- New audio CD inspector for source audio CDs.
- The "Total size" is now displayed inside the size indicator.
- Redesigned the BlankPanel.
- Parameters for the programs are now saved in a different format.
  Each bundle uses its own dictionary inside NSUserDefaults, which
  is much cleaner (conversion is done on the fly).
- The mkisofs bundle recognizes some more ISO options.

Fixed Bugs/Issues:
- The outline view did nor accept tracks that where dragged
  from another or the same compilation window. The type was not
  registered.
- Accepted tracks (by DnD) sometimes got the wrong track type
  assigned.
- Removed a bug where open compilation windows were not properly
  closed by the application, i.e. they did not get the internal
  'are you all ready to shut down?' message.
  This message is gone now.

Version 0.3.6
-------------

Fixed Bugs/Issues:

- Fixed the crash when opening the Preferences panel and two more
  crashes in ToolPanel and Track, all having to do with writing to the
  logging console.
- Fixed the bug where editing a track name would not work.
- Fixed the bug when Burn crashed upon trying to do more than one Open file'.

Version 0.3.5
-------------

New features:

- Burn.app employs only one (main) window changing it's contents,
  when CD descriptions are opened or closed.
- Gormified main window.
- Burn accepts tracks being dragged from CDPlayer's track list.
- Burn uses the TOC service provided by CDPlayer 0.4.0.
- Burn now offers one service allowing it to add selected audio CD
  tracks (e.g. CDPlayer 0.4.0) as well as files.
- The BurnParameters panel went away. Instead the parameters appear
  now in the main window (most important settings) and in the prefs
  panels (less important stuff).
- Preferences panel is now non-modal.
- The button bar in the main panel has gone.
- The console window is a text view now, instead of a table.
- Console messages can now be prioritized.
- All output (logging and tools' output) now goes to the console.
- Added a on-line help.

Removed Features:

- As dragging and dropping for CD tracks has been implemented,
  there is no longer need for an own mechanism to read an audio
  CD's TOC.
- Support for Cddb/FreeDB has been removed. As Burn is supposed
  to no longer handle audio CDs on its own, but to get the related
  data from CDPlayer (or any other similar app), Cddb support
  has become obsolete here. It should be handled in the application
  providing the source track data.
- The details part of BurnProgress panel has gone (uses console instead).

Fixed Bugs/Issues:

- As console output is decoupled from message sender completely, now,
  using an update timer, the sporadic crashes while burning should
  have gone now for good. Methinks, they were related to updating the
  GUI fron a background thread. Not sure, though.
- Another bug has gone that was related to re-start the burning. The
  progress panel left a (static) pointer dangling which was reused when
  the panel opened again.


Version 0.3.0.1
---------------

Fixed Bugs/Issues:

- All NSScrollViews now get their border explicitly set to make them
  look good with gnustep-gui 0.8.4.
- The NSPopUpButtons without an attached action are now enabled.
- Burn.app would crash when more than one displayed track name was edited
  in the outline view. This was due to the icons being released too often.


Version 0.3.0
-------------

New features:

- The discrimination between audio and data projects has gone. There
  are only projects now containing audio as well as data.
  This means that you cannow create mixed mode CDs (_not_ CDplus!).
- The track list now uses an outline view instead of a table view.
  This visually separates data tracks from audio tracks.
- The track list also employs icons, now, to distiguish between different
  track types.
- The CD list has gone from the project view. It is in a separate
  panel, now.
- 'Add File(s)' has gone. Files are being added using GWorkspace and Dnd
  or services.
- Burn parameters and tool choice are now in two panels floating
  around on the desktop to make it easier to change settings. All
  parameters are restored in the next session of Burn.app.
- The modal burn parameters dialog before burning starts has now
  gone for good.
- Several parameters have moved from the settings panels to the new
  burn parameter panel as they are more burning related and may
  change pretty often.
- Burn.app now uses CDPlayer.app's AudioCD.bundle to load audio CDs
  and read their TOC.
- Burn.app can now blank CD-RW.
- Burn.app has two inspectors, Track Inspector and Media Inspector to
  get additional information about tracks and inserted media.
- The layout of the installation directories has changed. The more
  common bundles (burners, ripper) appear in a common place, now
  (Library/Bundles) while the Burn.app specific bundles still are in
  Burn.app's installation directory.
- A lot of GUI stuff has been rewritten as Gorm projects.
- BurnProgressController is now responsible for removing temporary files.
  The ripping bundle (CDparanoia.bundle) does no longer have to do this
  itself.
- BurnProgressController can now hide the raw output window.
- Old GSburn project files (.gsaud) will no longer be loaded. Noone used
  them probably, anyway.

Fixed bugs:


Version 0.2.2
-------------

New features:

Fixed bugs:

- The CDDBID for an audio CD is calculated correctly now. Before
  the offset for the first track was wrong.
- Ripper/burner bundles now set their status correctly to isCancelled
  when the process exited unnormally.
- Burner bundles now correctly se their status when they must do
  more than one copy. The status does not go to an intermediate
  isStopped anymore.
- The timer handling in AudioProgressController is more robust now.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

New features:

- Whole directories containing audio files can now be dropped
  onto the audio project window. All audio files are added to
  project.
- GSburn.app provides now two services for creating a new
  project from the selected audio files and adding the selected
  audio files to the top most open project.
- GSburn.app now creates one subdirectory for each CD and stores
  the ripped tracks there instead of using one huge storage for all.
- FreeDB info can now be retrieved automatically for the selected CD.
- It is possible now to switch off automatic FreeDB access on
  loading a CD.
- A small animation now shows the progress while loading CD and
  accessing FreeDB.
- The Cdrdao.bundle now accepts .au files. Those files are converted
  to .wav files before they are burned. The .wav are removed afterwards.
- Both burning bundles allow .cdr files.
- Added NSIcon property for audio project file type (.gsaud).
- Added/changed a couple of icons.

Fixed Bugs:

- The burn progress panel no longer closes after pressing the
  'Cancel' button, but stays open until the user clicks 'Close'.
  Thus you can check the output messages.
- The output view now works again with gnustep-gui 0.8.2.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

New features:

- All external tools are wrapped in bundles, now.
- New and improved progress panel. Panel now shows
  not only disk and track progress, but also buffer
  fill level for burning and output of external tools.
- Files can now be added to a project using drag-and-drop
  from GWorkspace.
- Reordering of tracks can now be done using drag-and-drop.
- Tracks can be copied between projects using drag-and-drop.
- Tracks can now also be moved using cut/copy/paste. This works
  in the same project as well as between projects.
- CDDB/FreeDB support usinf Yen-Ju Chen's Cddb.bundle.
- Several new icons.
- Partial French localisation.
- Partial documentation for the classes.

Fixed Bugs:

- Track duration is now correctly displayed in MSF format.


Version 0.1.1
-------------

New Features:

- Burning of audio tracks with cdrdao and cdrecord.
- Editing of track titles, cd titles, and artists in
  project window.

Fixed Bugs:

- 'Project - Save As...' works now without the project
  being edited.


Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial version. Features:

- Grabbing of audio tracks with cdparanoia.
- Burning of audio tracks with cdrecord.
- Burn using DAO and TAO.
