AudioConverter.bundle
=====================
AudioConverter.bundle is a supportig bundle for Burn.app. It implements the
API for Burn.app's audio file conversion bundles. AudioConverter.bundle
converts, as its name implies, all kinds of audio files into wav audio files
which can be burned onto a CD playable in your home stereo.
AudioConverter.bundle uses ffmpeg or avconv to do the actual work.


Requirements
============

Burn.app
--------
As AudioConverter.bundle is a suporting bundle for Burn.app you will of
course need the application. Otherwise the bundle is of no use
for you.
Download the latest version from here:
http://gsburn.sourceforge.net

avconf/ffmpeg
-------------
ffmpeg is a cross-platform audio and video conversion tool. avconv is a fork
of the very same which operates slightly different, but has the same interface.
It is just a matter of personal preference or your OS's default, which one to
use.
AudioConverter.bundle uses ffmpeg/avconv to produce wav files. Neither of them
is part of the package, you will need to install it separately. Most distros
provide an installable package of either the one or the other.

Installation
============

In the bundle's source code directory type:

> make
> make install

This will install the bundle in a place where it can be automatically
found by Burn.app.
