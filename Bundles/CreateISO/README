CreateIso.bundle
================
CreateIso.bundle is a supportig bundle for Burn.app.  It implements the API
for Burn.app's ISO image creation backends and thus can be used as a direct
replacement for the built-in MkIsoFs.bundle.  CreateIso.bundle uses libisofs
and libburn to accomplish the task of creating the CD image.

Requirements
============

Burn.app
--------
As CreateIso.bundle is a suporting bundle for Burn.app you will of course need
the application. Otherwise the bundle is of no use for you.
Download the latest version from here:
http://gsburn.sourceforge.net

libburn/libisofs
----------------
libburn is an open-source library for reading, mastering and writing optical
discs. libisofs is part of the same package and responsible for the creation
of the ISO image.
Both libraries are not part of the package, you will need to install it
separately. You may get the libraries here:
http://icculus.org/burn
Mind, that you will need the latest version from CVS. CreateISO.bundle does
_not_ work with the current release 0.2.

NOTE: AFAIK, libburn currently only works under Linux. Moreober, it can handle
SCSI devices only at the moment, which is, of course not a problem for
building an ISO image.


Installation
============

In the bundle's source code directory type:

> make
> make install

This will install the bundle in a place where it can be automatically found by
Burn.app.

If, during make, you get an error message saying that 'libburn/libburn.h' or
'libburn/libisofs' cannot be found you will need to edit the GNUmakefile.
Search for the definition of the variable 'LIBBURN_INCLUDEDIR' and correct
the path for your system.
