Cdrdao.bundle
=============
Cdrdao.bundle is a supportig bundle for Burn.app. It implements the
API for Burn.app's CD burning bundles and thus can be used as a
direct replacement for the built-in CDrecord.bundle.
Cdrdao.bundle wraps the CD burning program cdrdao.


Requirements
============

Burn.app
--------
As Cdrdao.bundle is a suporting bundle for Burn.app you will of
course need the application. Otherwise thebundle is of no use
for you.
Download the latest version from here:
http://gsburn.sourceforge.net

cdrdao
------
Cdrdao.bundle is simply a frontend for the cdrdao program. This
program (or its sources) are not part of this package. You will
need to intall cdrdao separately. See your distro's install
instructions for how o do this. You may also ge cdrdao from
http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net and install it from from source.

Cdrdao.bundle has been tested with the following versions of cdrdao:

1.1.5, 1.1.7, 1.1.9
To use ATAPI devices under Linux without the SCSI emulation driver
you need at least version 1.1.8.


Installation
============

In the bundle's source code directory type:

> make
> make install

This will install the bundle in a place where it can be automatically
found by Burn.app.
