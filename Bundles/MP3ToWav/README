MP3ToWav.bundle
===============
MP3ToWav.bundle is a supportig bundle for Burn.app. It implements the
API for Burn.app's audio file conversion bundles. MP3ToWav.bundle
converts, as its name implies, mp3 audio files into wav audio files
which can be burned onto a CD playable in your home stereo.
MP3ToWav.bundle is based on the code of mpg321. I have simplified
the code as I merely need the wav file output and not the playing part.
I also converted the C code into Objective C.


Requirements
============

Burn.app
--------
As MP3ToWav.bundle is a suporting bundle for Burn.app you will of
course need the application. Otherwise the bundle is of no use
for you.
Download the latest version from here:

libao
-----
Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to
output audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.
MP3ToWav.bundle uses libao to produce wav files.
libao is not part of the package, you will need to install it
separately. If your distro does not provide an installable package
for libao you may get it here:

libmad
------
MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to lower sampling frequencies,
as well as the de facto MPEG 2.5 format.
MP3ToWab.bundle uses libmad to decode the MP3 files before being
able to write them as wav files.
libmad is not part of the package, you will need to install it
separately. If your distro does not provide an installable package
for libmad you may get it here:

Installation
============

In the bundle's source code directory type:

> make
> make install

This will install the bundle in a place where it can be automatically
found by Burn.app.
