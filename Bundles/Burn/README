Burn.bundle
===============
Burn.bundle is a supportig bundle for Burn.app.  It implements the
API for Burn.app's CD burning bundles and thus can be used as a
direct replacement for the built-in CDrecord.bundle.
Burn.bundle uses libburn to accomplish the task of burning a CD.

Requirements
============

Burn.app
--------
As Burn.bundle is a suporting bundle for Burn.app you will of
course need the application. Otherwise thebundle is of no use
for you.
Download the latest version from here:
http://gsburn.sourceforge.net

libburn
-----
libburn is an open-source library for reading, mastering and
writing optical discs.
libburn is not part of the package, you will need to install it
separately. If your distro does not provide an installable package
for libburn you may get it here:
http://icculus.org/burn


Installation
============

In the bundle's source code directory type:

> make
> make install

This will install the bundle in a place where it can be automatically
found by Burn.app.

If, during make, you get an error message saying that 'libburn/libburn.h'
cannot be found you will need to edit the GNUmakefile. Search for the
definition of the variable 'LIBBURN_INCLUDEDIR' and correct the path for
your system.
