- When trying to get media information from a CD-ROM, cdrecord
  and cdrdao backends crash. Might be a problem parsing the output.

- When copying tracks from so-called 'enhanced audio CDs' (e.g.
  The Tea Party - Alhambra) the length of the first track is not
  correctly displayed. It includes the length of the data track.
  However, ripping and burning works.
